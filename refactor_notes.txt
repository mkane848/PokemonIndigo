General Notes:
- :: references to Pkmn or item names need to be removed
    ex.  pbPlayCry(PBSpecies::<PKMN>) -> Pokemon.play_cry(:<PKMN>)
         pbItemBall(::<itemName>)  ->  pbItemBall(:<itemName>)
- hasType(), hasItem(), etc. can replace janky code
    > $player.has_pokemon_of_type?(:TYPE)
- Replace pbItemBall() with pbReceiveItem() when getting an item FROM someone, 2nd arg can be given for quantity
- Are double battles working correctly? Should I be in a 2v1, or am I supposed to be fighting alongside someone?
    ex. Erika & the 2 bikers fight


Customizations to fix/update:
1. Custom Megas 
    - Pikachu
    - Lapras
    - Machamp


BUGS/TODO
1. Pokemon jump/dust? animation is off, the landing part of the jump cloud is too low
2. Surfing being on without pokemon is a debug feature, right?
3. 2nd pokemon not properly going out for double battle?
    - Mewtwo sprite goes out, Zoroark moveset loads?
    - Used one move then it corrected itself
4. Move Deleter/Rememberer
5. Shops/Paralyze Heal
6. Put custom item assets back in (no thumbnail when hovering item in Bag)
7. ESCALADA interaction does not trigger
    - Assuming its similar to 
8. EBDX missing/broken assets
    - AI_MoveEffects has_active_ability?
9. Encounter data reformat
10. Move all of the Trainer EndSpeech text from the Event and into the Trainer info

IDEAS
1. Randomize gym leaders but preserve their types, make sure their last Pkmn is their "boss"
2. Generation on/off from debug
