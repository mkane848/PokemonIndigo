BUGS
1. Pokemon jump/dust? animation is off, the landing part of the jump cloud is too low
2. Surfing being on without pokemon is a debug feature, right?
3. 2nd pokemon not properly going out for double battle?
    - Mewtwo sprite goes out, Zoroark moveset loads?
    - Used one move then it corrected itself
4. Move Deleter/Rememberer
5. Shops/Paralyze Heal
6. Put custom item assets back in (no thumbnail when hovering item in Bag)

IDEAS
1. Randomize gym leaders but preserve their types, make sure their last Pkmn is their "boss"
2. Generation on/off from debug
