General Notes:
- :: references to Pkmn or item names need to be removed
    ex.  pbPlayCry(PBSpecies::<PKMN>) -> Pokemon.play_cry(:<PKMN>)
         pbItemBall(::<itemName>)  ->  pbItemBall(:<itemName>)
- hasType(), hasItem(), etc. can replace janky code
    > $player.has_pokemon_of_type?(:TYPE)
- Replace pbItemBall() with pbReceiveItem() when getting an item FROM someone, 2nd arg can be given for quantity
- Are double battles working correctly? Should I be in a 2v1, or am I supposed to be fighting alongside someone?
    ex. Erika & the 2 bikers fight


Customizations to fix/update:
1. Custom Megas 
    - Pikachu
    - Lapras
    - Machamp


BUGS/TODO
1. Pokemon jump/dust? animation is off, the landing part of the jump cloud is too low
2. Surfing being on without pokemon is a debug feature, right?
3. 2nd pokemon not properly going out for double battle?
    - Mewtwo sprite goes out, Zoroark moveset loads?
    - Used one move then it corrected itself
4. Move Deleter/Rememberer
5. Shops/Paralyze Heal
6. Put custom item assets back in (no thumbnail when hovering item in Bag)
7. ESCALADA interaction does not trigger
    - Assuming its similar to 
8. EBDX missing/broken assets
    - AI_MoveEffects has_active_ability?
9. Encounter data reformat
10. Move all of the Trainer EndSpeech text from the Event and into the Trainer info
    - See what trainers have mid-fight dialogue
11. pbWildBattle -> WildBattle.start + check arguments:
    - Ariados in Viridian Gym
12. Double check trainer Event Touch vs Action Button to trigger trainer battles, some seem wrong
13. $player.has_species?
14. Double check all instances of frame-rate being locked then frame-waiting
    - Essentials moved away from frame-based timing, need to look at how this affects things
15. Dragonite sprite didnt appear when Lance saves you from Team Rocket?
16. Issue with ESCALADA = ON Switch?
17. Rework the Battlebacks and BGM, see what can be preserved from Anil
18. Armored Mewtwo fight - nota del juego - este combate no se tiene en cuenta en el reto Nuzlocke
    -game note - this fight does not count towards the Nuzlocke challenge
19. "Aspirante David" walked through a different elevation to challenge in Mt Silver
20. Check Ash's Pikachu form

IDEAS
1. Randomize gym leaders but preserve their types, make sure their last Pkmn is their "boss"
2. Generation on/off from debug
